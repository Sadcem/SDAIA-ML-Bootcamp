SDAIA Machine Learning Bootcamp Projects

Overview

During my tenure as a Machine Learning Bootcamp Intern at SDAIA (Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority), I embarked on an intensive journey into the realm of machine learning. The experience has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of machine learning concepts and preparing me for future challenges in the field.

Learning Path

Starting with the fundamentals of data preprocessing, I progressed through a range of topics, including:

	•	Supervised Learning: Implemented various supervised learning models such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and more.
	•	Unsupervised Learning: Gained experience in clustering and other unsupervised techniques.
	•	Model Evaluation: Conducted statistical evaluations of models to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness.

Skills Acquired

By the conclusion of the bootcamp, I emerged equipped with the knowledge and skills to:

	•	Design Machine Learning Models: From scratch, based on problem requirements.
	•	Train Algorithms: Build and train models using diverse data sets.
	•	Evaluate Models: Use appropriate metrics to assess the performance of algorithms and make informed decisions.

Projects

1. Hotel Booking Data Cleaning

	•	Objective: Clean and preprocess hotel booking data for further analysis.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Dealt with missing and duplicate data.
	•	Performed feature selection to remove irrelevant or redundant features.
	•	Applied data transformation techniques for uniformity in data.

2. Loan Approval System

	•	Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant information.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Built a logistic regression model to classify loan applications as approved or rejected.
	•	Conducted feature engineering to create new variables that improved model performance.
	•	Evaluated the model using precision and recall to focus on correctly predicting approvals and rejections.

3. Diabetes Prediction Using Linear Regression

	•	Objective: Predict the likelihood of diabetes onset in patients based on historical medical data.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Cleaned and preprocessed medical data to prepare for modeling.
	•	Applied linear regression to predict the onset of diabetes based on features like BMI, glucose levels, and age.
	•	Evaluated the model using mean squared error and visualized prediction accuracy through scatter plots.

4. Swine Flu Detection Using Decision Trees

	•	Objective: Create a decision tree model to detect swine flu cases based on patient symptoms.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Preprocessed patient symptom data, including feature selection and missing value imputation.
	•	Built a decision tree to classify cases as swine flu positive or negative.
	•	Pruned the decision tree to reduce complexity and improve generalization.

5. Smoker Detection Using Classification Models

	•	Objective: Use machine learning models to determine whether a person is a smoker based on demographic and medical data.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Implemented logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors to classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers.
	•	Compared model performance using confusion matrices and AUC-ROC curves.
	•	Focused on improving recall to better identify smokers from the dataset.

6. Predictive Modeling Using Regression Techniques

	•	Objective: Use multi-linear regression to predict continuous outcomes in various scenarios.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Worked on diverse datasets requiring prediction of continuous variables (e.g., housing prices, insurance premiums).
	•	Optimized models through feature selection and regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression.
	•	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared and root mean square error (RMSE).

Key Takeaways

	•	Gained a solid understanding of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
	•	Developed the ability to transform raw datasets into actionable insights using machine learning algorithms.
	•	Mastered model evaluation techniques to ensure that the models were not only accurate but also generalizable to unseen data.
	•	Learned to optimize models through hyperparameter tuning and regularization to prevent overfitting.

Conclusion

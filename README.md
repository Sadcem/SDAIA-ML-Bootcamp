# SDAIA Machine Learning Bootcamp
During my tenure as a Machine Learning Bootcamp Intern at SDAIA, I embarked on an intensive journey into the realm of machine learning.
Starting with the fundamentals of data preprocessing, I progressed through supervised and unsupervised learning models, and engaged in statistical model evaluation. By the conclusion of the program, I emerged equipped with the knowledge and skills to design, train, and evaluate cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, enabling me to transform raw data into actionable insights.
My experience at SDAIA has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of machine learning concepts and preparing me for future challenges in the field.
